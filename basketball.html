		<p class="six">Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, an American. At the time, he was teaching at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Due to the local abundance of peaches, children here also like to play the game of throwing a ball into the peach basket. This inspired him to draw on the characteristics of other ball games such as football and hockey and create basketball games.It was not until the late 1950s that Tony Sinkel introduced brown basketballs for the sport. At the beginning of the basketball game, the number of players, the size of the field, and the game time are not strictly limited, as long as the number of people is equal to the game. In 1932, the first international basketball Conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland, and the International Amateur Basketball Association was established in Rome in the same year. In 1948, FIBA decided to hold the World Basketball Championship every four years from 1950, and in 2012, it was renamed the Men's Basketball World Cup.</p></div>

   	   	<p style="font-size: 34px;">In the sports industry, the contribution of the sportswear industry can reach 30%-45%. Therefore, in economically developed countries, especially in countries where professional sports are also developed, the sportswear industry has become one of the important driving forces for national economic growth. Among the many clothing brands, the most eye-catching is Nike.

Through the mining and application of basketball elements, Nike has become a successful model of sports enterprise brand marketing. Since 1972, when basketball player Sandy Wicks put on Nike basketball shoes and galloped in the NBA arena, Nike Sporting Goods has developed a series of basketball products, using basketball elements to enhance the influence of their brand. At that time, Germany's Adidas and Puma occupied the first-mover advantage, but the basketball market became a weapon for Nike's flanking attack. Jordan's "flying shoes" is the beginning of the Nike myth.</p>
